Scenario 1: Validate the creation of a valid low-pass filter
Details:
  TestName: test_valid_lowpass_filter_creation
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the function can create a valid low-pass filter based on the provided parameters. This is the core functionality of the function and must operate as expected.
Execution:
  Arrange: Define a frequency, samplerate, and q_factor.
  Act: Call the function with the defined parameters.
  Assert: Check that the returned object is an instance of IIRFilter and that the coefficients match the expected values.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function can create a low-pass filter as expected. The correctness of the coefficients is crucial to the filter's operation.

Scenario 2: Validate handling of zero frequency
Details:
  TestName: test_zero_frequency_handling
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the function can handle a zero frequency input. This is an edge case that may occur in certain scenarios.
Execution:
  Arrange: Define a frequency of 0, a samplerate, and a q_factor.
  Act: Call the function with the defined parameters.
  Assert: Check that the returned object is an instance of IIRFilter and that the coefficients match the expected values.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function can handle a zero frequency input, which might happen in certain scenarios. It is important to handle this edge case to prevent unexpected behaviors.

Scenario 3: Validate handling of zero samplerate
Details:
  TestName: test_zero_samplerate_handling
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the function can handle a zero samplerate input. This is an edge case that may lead to division by zero.
Execution:
  Arrange: Define a frequency, a samplerate of 0, and a q_factor.
  Act: Call the function with the defined parameters.
  Assert: Check that the function raises an exception.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function can handle a zero samplerate input. It is important to handle this edge case to prevent a division by zero error.

Scenario 4: Validate handling of negative frequency
Details:
  TestName: test_negative_frequency_handling
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the function can handle a negative frequency input. This is an edge case that may occur in certain scenarios.
Execution:
  Arrange: Define a negative frequency, a samplerate, and a q_factor.
  Act: Call the function with the defined parameters.
  Assert: Check that the returned object is an instance of IIRFilter and that the coefficients match the expected values.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function can handle a negative frequency input, which might happen in certain scenarios. It is important to handle this edge case to prevent unexpected behaviors.

Scenario 5: Validate handling of negative q_factor
Details:
  TestName: test_negative_qfactor_handling
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the function can handle a negative q_factor input. This is an edge case that may occur in certain scenarios.
Execution:
  Arrange: Define a frequency, a samplerate, and a negative q_factor.
  Act: Call the function with the defined parameters.
  Assert: Check that the function raises an exception.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function can handle a negative q_factor input. It is important to handle this edge case to prevent unexpected behaviors.
