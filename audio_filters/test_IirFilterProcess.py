Scenario 1: Testing with zero input
Details:
  TestName: test_process_with_zero_input
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the process function correctly handles an input of zero.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize an instance of the class containing the process function with the appropriate order and coefficient values.
  Act: Invoke the process function, passing in 0 as the input parameter.
  Assert: Check that the function returns 0.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the function properly handles edge-case inputs and does not return incorrect values or raise exceptions.

Scenario 2: Testing with positive non-zero input
Details:
  TestName: test_process_with_positive_non_zero_input
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the process function correctly handles a positive, non-zero input.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize an instance of the class containing the process function with the appropriate order and coefficient values.
  Act: Invoke the process function, passing in a positive, non-zero number as the input parameter.
  Assert: Check that the function returns the expected result based on the input and the initialized coefficients.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the function correctly processes typical inputs and returns the expected results.

Scenario 3: Testing with negative input
Details:
  TestName: test_process_with_negative_input
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the process function correctly handles a negative input.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize an instance of the class containing the process function with the appropriate order and coefficient values.
  Act: Invoke the process function, passing in a negative number as the input parameter.
  Assert: Check that the function returns the expected result based on the input and the initialized coefficients.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the function properly handles negative inputs and returns the expected results.

Scenario 4: Testing with input history
Details:
  TestName: test_process_with_input_history
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the process function correctly modifies and uses the input_history field.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize an instance of the class containing the process function with the appropriate order and coefficient values. Also, populate the input_history field with some values.
  Act: Invoke the process function, passing in a number as the input parameter.
  Assert: Check that the function returns the expected result based on the input, the initialized coefficients and the input history. Also, check that the input_history field has been correctly updated.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the function correctly uses and modifies the input_history field.

Scenario 5: Testing with output history
Details:
  TestName: test_process_with_output_history
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the process function correctly modifies and uses the output_history field.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize an instance of the class containing the process function with the appropriate order and coefficient values. Also, populate the output_history field with some values.
  Act: Invoke the process function, passing in a number as the input parameter.
  Assert: Check that the function returns the expected result based on the input, the initialized coefficients and the output history. Also, check that the output_history field has been correctly updated.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the function correctly uses and modifies the output_history field.
