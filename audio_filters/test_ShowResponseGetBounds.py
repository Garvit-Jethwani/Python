Scenario 1: Testing with a normal range of values
Details:
  TestName: test_get_bounds_normal_values
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the get_bounds function correctly determines the bounds of the FFT results when provided with a normal range of values.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize an ndarray of evenly spaced numbers over a specified interval using numpy's linspace function. Set the samplerate to an integer value.
  Act: Call the get_bounds function with the initialized ndarray and samplerate.
  Assert: Check that the returned tuple matches the expected bounds.
Validation:
  The importance of this test is to confirm that the function works as expected under normal operating conditions. The expected result is tied to the function's specification of returning the correct bounds for the FFT results.

Scenario 2: Testing with all negative values
Details:
  TestName: test_get_bounds_all_negative_values
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the get_bounds function correctly determines the bounds when all FFT results are negative.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize an ndarray of evenly spaced negative numbers over a certain interval. Set the samplerate to an integer value.
  Act: Call the get_bounds function with the initialized ndarray and samplerate.
  Assert: Check that the returned tuple matches the expected bounds.
Validation:
  This test is important because it verifies the function's ability to handle scenarios where all FFT results are negative. The expected result is connected to the function's business requirement of determining the correct bounds.

Scenario 3: Testing with a single value
Details:
  TestName: test_get_bounds_single_value
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the get_bounds function correctly determines the bounds when the FFT results consist of a single unique value.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize an ndarray with a single unique value repeated throughout. Set the samplerate to an integer value.
  Act: Call the get_bounds function with the initialized ndarray and samplerate.
  Assert: Check that the returned tuple matches the expected bounds.
Validation:
  This test is important because it checks the function's behavior in edge cases where there is no variance in the FFT results. The expected result is tied to the function's specification of returning the correct bounds.

Scenario 4: Testing with zero-value samplerate
Details:
  TestName: test_get_bounds_zero_samplerate
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the get_bounds function correctly handles a zero-value samplerate.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize an ndarray of evenly spaced numbers over a certain interval. Set the samplerate to zero.
  Act: Call the get_bounds function with the initialized ndarray and samplerate.
  Assert: Check that the function returns an error or handles the situation gracefully.
Validation:
  This test is important because it verifies the function's behavior under edge case scenarios where the samplerate is zero. The expected result is tied to the function's specification and business requirement of handling edge cases correctly.
