Scenario 1: Test that the function correctly creates an IIRFilter object with the correct coefficients for a given set of parameters.
Details:
  TestName: test_make_peak_correct_coefficients
  Description: This test verifies that the function correctly calculates and sets the coefficients of the IIRFilter object it creates based on the input parameters.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup is required other than preparing the input parameters.
  Act: Call the function with a known set of parameters.
  Assert: Check that the coefficients of the returned IIRFilter object match the expected values.
Validation:
  This test is important because it verifies the core functionality of the function, which is to create an IIRFilter object with the correct coefficients. The expected result is directly related to the function's specifications and business requirements.

Scenario 2: Test that the function correctly handles a gain of 0 dB.
Details:
  TestName: test_make_peak_zero_gain
  Description: This test verifies that the function correctly handles a gain of 0 dB, which should result in a filter that does not change the input signal.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup is required other than preparing the input parameters.
  Act: Call the function with a gain of 0 dB.
  Assert: Check that the coefficients of the returned IIRFilter object correspond to a filter that does not change the input signal.
Validation:
  This test is important because it checks that the function correctly handles a special case that could occur in practice. The expected result is directly related to the function's specifications and business requirements.

Scenario 3: Test that the function correctly handles a negative gain.
Details:
  TestName: test_make_peak_negative_gain
  Description: This test verifies that the function correctly handles a negative gain, which should result in a filter that reduces the amplitude of the input signal.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup is required other than preparing the input parameters.
  Act: Call the function with a negative gain.
  Assert: Check that the coefficients of the returned IIRFilter object correspond to a filter that reduces the amplitude of the input signal.
Validation:
  This test is important because it checks that the function correctly handles a special case that could occur in practice. The expected result is directly related to the function's specifications and business requirements.

Scenario 4: Test that the function correctly handles a frequency of 0 Hz.
Details:
  TestName: test_make_peak_zero_frequency
  Description: This test verifies that the function correctly handles a frequency of 0 Hz, which should result in a filter that does not change the input signal.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup is required other than preparing the input parameters.
  Act: Call the function with a frequency of 0 Hz.
  Assert: Check that the coefficients of the returned IIRFilter object correspond to a filter that does not change the input signal.
Validation:
  This test is important because it checks that the function correctly handles a special case that could occur in practice. The expected result is directly related to the function's specifications and business requirements.
