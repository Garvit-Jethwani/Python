ROOST_METHOD_SIG_HASH=process_5af1487270

Scenario 1: Test for positive float input
Details:
  TestName: test_process_with_positive_float
  Description: The test is intended to verify the expected output when a positive float is passed as an argument to the process method.
Execution:
  Arrange: Instantiate the class, if needed.
  Act: Call the process method with a positive float as an argument.
  Assert: Check that the output is a float.
Validation:
  This is an important test as it verifies the method’s functionality with positive float values. It is expected that the method should handle such values without errors and return a float output.

Scenario 2: Test for negative float input
Details:
  TestName: test_process_with_negative_float
  Description: The test is intended to verify the expected output when a negative float is passed as an argument to the process method.
Execution:
  Arrange: Instantiate the class, if needed.
  Act: Call the process method with a negative float as an argument.
  Assert: Check that the output is a float.
Validation:
  This is an important test as it verifies the method’s functionality with negative float values. It is expected that the method should handle such values without errors and return a float output.

Scenario 3: Test for zero input
Details:
  TestName: test_process_with_zero
  Description: The test is intended to verify the expected output when zero is passed as an argument to the process method.
Execution:
  Arrange: Instantiate the class, if needed.
  Act: Call the process method with zero as an argument.
  Assert: Check that the output is a float.
Validation:
  This test is essential as it checks the method’s behavior when zero is passed as an argument. It is expected that the method should handle such a value without errors and return a float output.

Scenario 4: Test for very large float input
Details:
  TestName: test_process_with_large_float
  Description: The test is intended to verify the expected output when a very large float is passed as an argument to the process method.
Execution:
  Arrange: Instantiate the class, if needed.
  Act: Call the process method with a very large float as an argument.
  Assert: Check that the output is a float.
Validation:
  This test is important as it checks the method’s ability to handle very large float values. It is expected that the method should handle such values without errors and return a float output.

Scenario 5: Test for very small float input
Details:
  TestName: test_process_with_small_float
  Description: The test is intended to verify the expected output when a very small float is passed as an argument to the process method.
Execution:
  Arrange: Instantiate the class, if needed.
  Act: Call the process method with a very small float as an argument.
  Assert: Check that the output is a float.
Validation:
  This test is important as it checks the method’s ability to handle very small float values. It is expected that the method should handle such values without errors and return a float output.
