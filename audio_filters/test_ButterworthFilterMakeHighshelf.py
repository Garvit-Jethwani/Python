Scenario 1: Validate the creation of a high-shelf filter with standard parameters
Details:
  TestName: test_make_highshelf_standard
  Description: This test verifies that the make_highshelf function correctly creates a high-shelf filter using standard parameters.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize frequency, samplerate, gain_db and q_factor with standard values.
  Act: Invoke the make_highshelf function with the initialized parameters.
  Assert: Check that the returned filter's a_coeffs and b_coeffs are as expected.
Validation:
  The test validates the core functionality of the make_highshelf function. The expected result is based on the mathematical model encapsulated by the function.

Scenario 2: Validate the creation of a high-shelf filter with maximum frequency
Details:
  TestName: test_make_highshelf_max_frequency
  Description: This test verifies that the make_highshelf function correctly handles the maximum possible frequency.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize frequency with its maximum possible value, and other parameters with standard values.
  Act: Invoke the make_highshelf function with the initialized parameters.
  Assert: Check that the returned filter's a_coeffs and b_coeffs are as expected.
Validation:
  This test assesses the function's ability to handle extreme values. It ensures the function correctly handles the maximum possible frequency value.

Scenario 3: Validate the creation of a high-shelf filter with minimum frequency
Details:
  TestName: test_make_highshelf_min_frequency
  Description: This test verifies that the make_highshelf function correctly handles the minimum possible frequency.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize frequency with its minimum possible value, and other parameters with standard values.
  Act: Invoke the make_highshelf function with the initialized parameters.
  Assert: Check that the returned filter's a_coeffs and b_coeffs are as expected.
Validation:
  This test assesses the function's ability to handle extreme values. It ensures the function correctly handles the minimum possible frequency value.

Scenario 4: Validate the creation of a high-shelf filter with zero gain
Details:
  TestName: test_make_highshelf_zero_gain
  Description: This test verifies that the make_highshelf function correctly handles a gain_db of zero.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize gain_db with zero, and other parameters with standard values.
  Act: Invoke the make_highshelf function with the initialized parameters.
  Assert: Check that the returned filter's a_coeffs and b_coeffs are as expected.
Validation:
  This test assesses the function's ability to handle special cases. It ensures the function correctly handles a gain_db of zero.

Scenario 5: Validate the creation of a high-shelf filter with a negative gain
Details:
  TestName: test_make_highshelf_negative_gain
  Description: This test verifies that the make_highshelf function correctly handles a negative gain_db.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize gain_db with a negative value, and other parameters with standard values.
  Act: Invoke the make_highshelf function with the initialized parameters.
  Assert: Check that the returned filter's a_coeffs and b_coeffs are as expected.
Validation:
  This test assesses the function's ability to handle special cases. It ensures the function correctly handles a negative gain_db.
