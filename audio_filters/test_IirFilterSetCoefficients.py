Scenario 1: Valid Coefficients of Order
Details:
  TestName: test_set_coefficients_valid_order
  Description: This test verifies that the set_coefficients function properly assigns coefficients when the lengths of the a_coeffs and b_coeffs lists are equal to the order + 1.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize an IIRFilter object with a specific order. Prepare valid a_coeffs and b_coeffs lists of length equal to filter order + 1.
  Act: Call set_coefficients on the filter object with the prepared a_coeffs and b_coeffs.
  Assert: Verify that the filter's a_coeffs and b_coeffs match the input lists.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function correctly assigns coefficients in a standard use case, adhering to the specifications and requirements of the function.

Scenario 2: Coefficients of Lesser Order
Details:
  TestName: test_set_coefficients_lesser_order
  Description: This test verifies that the set_coefficients function properly prepends 1.0 to the a_coeffs list when its length is less than the order.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize an IIRFilter object with a specific order. Prepare an a_coeffs list of length less than filter order and a valid b_coeffs list.
  Act: Call set_coefficients on the filter object with the prepared a_coeffs and b_coeffs.
  Assert: Verify that the filter's a_coeffs list is prepended with 1.0 and the b_coeffs list matches the input list.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function correctly handles a_coeffs lists of lesser order, adhering to the specifications and requirements of the function.

Scenario 3: Coefficients of Greater Order
Details:
  TestName: test_set_coefficients_greater_order
  Description: This test verifies that the set_coefficients function raises a ValueError when the lengths of the a_coeffs and b_coeffs lists are greater than the order + 1.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize an IIRFilter object with a specific order. Prepare a_coeffs and b_coeffs lists of length greater than filter order + 1.
  Act: Call set_coefficients on the filter object with the prepared a_coeffs and b_coeffs.
  Assert: Assert that a ValueError is raised with a message indicating the lengths of the lists are incorrect.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function correctly raises an error when coefficients of greater order are provided, adhering to the specifications and requirements of the function.

Scenario 4: Coefficients of Invalid Order
Details:
  TestName: test_set_coefficients_invalid_order
  Description: This test verifies that the set_coefficients function raises a ValueError when the lengths of the a_coeffs and b_coeffs lists are not equal to the order + 1 and not less than the order.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize an IIRFilter object with a specific order. Prepare a_coeffs and b_coeffs lists of length not equal to filter order + 1 and not less than the order.
  Act: Call set_coefficients on the filter object with the prepared a_coeffs and b_coeffs.
  Assert: Assert that a ValueError is raised with a message indicating the lengths of the lists are incorrect.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function correctly raises an error when coefficients of an invalid order are provided, adhering to the specifications and requirements of the function.
