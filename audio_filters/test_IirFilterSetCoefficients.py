Scenario 1: Test the successful setting of coefficients
Details:
  TestName: test_successful_set_coefficients
  Description: This test is intended to verify the successful setting of valid coefficients to the IIR filter.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the IIRFilter object with a certain order, and prepare valid coefficients of size order + 1.
  Act: Invoke the set_coefficients function with the prepared coefficients.
  Assert: Check if the coefficients have been set correctly by comparing them with the input coefficients.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure the basic functionality of setting coefficients is working as expected. The successful execution of this scenario would mean the function is correctly setting the coefficients.

Scenario 2: Test the setting of coefficients when a_coeffs list has less than order elements
Details:
  TestName: test_set_coefficients_with_less_a_coeffs
  Description: This test is intended to verify the automatic addition of 1.0 to the a_coeffs list when its size is less than the order.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the IIRFilter object with a certain order, and prepare a_coeffs of size less than order and valid b_coeffs.
  Act: Invoke the set_coefficients function with the prepared coefficients.
  Assert: Check if the a_coeffs have been set correctly by comparing them with the input coefficients, considering the automatic addition of 1.0.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the function is correctly handling the situation when a_coeffs list has less than order elements. The successful execution of this scenario would mean the function is correctly adding 1.0 to the a_coeffs list in such cases.

Scenario 3: Test setting coefficients with invalid a_coeffs size
Details:
  TestName: test_set_coefficients_with_invalid_a_coeffs_size
  Description: This test is intended to verify the function's behavior when the size of a_coeffs is not equal to order + 1.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the IIRFilter object with a certain order, and prepare a_coeffs and b_coeffs of sizes not equal to order + 1.
  Act: Invoke the set_coefficients function with the prepared coefficients.
  Assert: Check if a ValueError is raised with the correct error message.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the function is correctly handling invalid input sizes for a_coeffs. The successful execution of this scenario would mean the function is correctly raising an error for such cases.

Scenario 4: Test setting coefficients with invalid b_coeffs size
Details:
  TestName: test_set_coefficients_with_invalid_b_coeffs_size
  Description: This test is intended to verify the function's behavior when the size of b_coeffs is not equal to order + 1.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the IIRFilter object with a certain order, and prepare a_coeffs and b_coeffs of sizes not equal to order + 1.
  Act: Invoke the set_coefficients function with the prepared coefficients.
  Assert: Check if a ValueError is raised with the correct error message.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the function is correctly handling invalid input sizes for b_coeffs. The successful execution of this scenario would mean the function is correctly raising an error for such cases.
