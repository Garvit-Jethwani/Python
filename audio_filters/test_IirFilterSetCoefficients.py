================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Insufficient Input Validation
Issue: The method set_coefficients does not perform kind and value check validation on its input, potentially leading to type and value errors, which can disrupt the program flow.
Solution: Implement comprehensive sanity checks such as type checking and value range checking for the inputs a_coeffs and b_coeffs. For instance, ensure the variables are of type list containing numbers and have values within a specific range if necessary.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Setting valid coefficients for the IIR filter
Details:
  TestName: test_set_valid_coefficients
  Description: This test is intended to verify if the function is able to set the coefficients correctly given the correct number of elements equal to the order of the filter plus 1.
Execution:
  Arrange: We'll initialize an instance of IIRFilter with a specified order.
  Act: We'll invoke the set_coefficients function with valid a_coeffs and b_coeffs, both of size order plus 1.
  Assert: The function should save the given coefficients to the instance variables, which we can then verify with direct field access.
Validation:
  We are ensuring that the basic operation of setting coefficients works as expected. This validates the correctness of the predefined parameter ranges and the condition where a_coeffs length is equal to order + 1.

Scenario 2: Setting coefficients with a smaller a_coeffs list
Details:
  TestName: test_set_coefficients_small_a_coeffs
  Description: This test verifies whether the function can successfully set coefficients when the length of the a_coeffs list is less than the filter's order.
Execution:
  Arrange: We'll initialize an instance of IIRFilter with a specified order.
  Act: We'll call the set_coefficients function, passing an a_coeffs list that is smaller than the order of the filter.
  Assert: The function handles this scenario by prepending 1.0 to the a_coeffs list before saving it to the instance variables, which we can verify.
Validation:
  By ensuring that a coeffs list shorter than the order is still valid input, we are testing a specific logic in the function that addresses this situation. This validates the function's error handling as described in its comments, in the context of an edge case.

Scenario 3: Setting coefficients with an invalid number of elements in a_coeffs list
Details:
  TestName: test_set_coefficients_invalid_a_coeffs_size
  Description: This test verifies the function's behavior when the a_coeffs list size is not equal to the order of the filter + 1.
Execution:
  Arrange: An instance of IIRFilter with a specified order would be initialized.
  Act: The set_coefficients function would be invoked, with an a_coeffs list of incompatible size.
  Assert: A ValueError should be raised with a relevant error message.
Validation:
  Testing this case ensures that the function correctly rejects inputs that are incompatible with the filter's order. This validates the function's robustness against erroneous inputs that are out of its predefined input domain.

Scenario 4: Setting coefficients with an invalid number of elements in b_coeffs list
Details:
  TestName: test_set_coefficients_invalid_b_coeffs_size
  Description: This test verifies the function's behavior when the b_coeffs list size is not equal to the order of the filter + 1.
Execution:
  Arrange: An instance of IIRFilter with a specified order would be initialized.
  Act: The set_coefficients function would be invoked, with a b_coeffs list of incompatible size.
  Assert: A ValueError should be raised with a relevant error message.
Validation:
  Testing this case ensures that the function correctly rejects inputs that are incompatible with the filter's order. This underpins the function's robustness against erroneous inputs that defy its predefined input domain.
