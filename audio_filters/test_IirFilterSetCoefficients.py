Scenario 1: Test the method with valid a_coeffs and b_coeffs lists
Details:
  TestName: test_set_coefficients_with_valid_inputs
  Description: This test is intended to verify if the method correctly sets the a_coeffs and b_coeffs attributes when provided with valid lists of coefficients.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class containing this method, and prepare two lists of float numbers.
  Act: Invoke the set_coefficients method with the two lists as parameters.
  Assert: Check if the a_coeffs and b_coeffs attributes of the class instance have been correctly set to the input lists.
Validation:
  This test checks the basic functionality of the method. It is important to ensure that the method works as expected with valid inputs.

Scenario 2: Test the method when a_coeffs list is smaller than the order
Details:
  TestName: test_set_coefficients_with_smaller_a_coeffs
  Description: This test is intended to verify if the method correctly sets the a_coeffs attribute when provided with a list that is smaller than the order.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class and prepare a list of float numbers that is smaller than the order.
  Act: Invoke the set_coefficients method with the list as the a_coeffs parameter.
  Assert: Check if the a_coeffs attribute of the class instance has been correctly set to 1.0 followed by the input list.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the method correctly handles the case when a_coeffs list is smaller than the order, as per the business logic of the method.

Scenario 3: Test the method when a_coeffs or b_coeffs list is larger than the order
Details:
  TestName: test_set_coefficients_with_larger_coefficients
  Description: This test is intended to verify if the method raises a ValueError when the a_coeffs or b_coeffs list is larger than the order.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class and prepare a list of float numbers that is larger than the order.
  Act: Invoke the set_coefficients method with the list as the a_coeffs or b_coeffs parameter.
  Assert: Check if a ValueError is raised.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the method correctly raises an error when a_coeffs or b_coeffs list is larger than the order, as per the business logic of the method.

Scenario 4: Test the method when a_coeffs or b_coeffs list is exactly the order
Details:
  TestName: test_set_coefficients_with_exact_order
  Description: This test is intended to verify if the method correctly sets the a_coeffs and b_coeffs attributes when the lists are exactly the order.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class and prepare two lists of float numbers that are exactly the order.
  Act: Invoke the set_coefficients method with the two lists as parameters.
  Assert: Check if the a_coeffs and b_coeffs attributes of the class instance have been correctly set to the input lists.
Validation:
  This test validates that the method correctly handles the case when a_coeffs and b_coeffs lists are exactly the order, as per the business logic of the method.
