================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Unverified input
Issue: Input types for 'a_coeffs' and 'b_coeffs' are unverified. If called with invalid input types, it may lead to TypeError.
Solution: Add necessary type check and raise appropriate exceptions when incorrect types are detected.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Successful coefficient assignment when both lists size matches the order + 1
Details:
  TestName: test_set_coefficients_success
  Description: This test case is intended to verify the successful assignment of coefficients when both lists of coefficients provided have size of order + 1.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the object of IIRFilter with the order of the filter and a_coeffs and b_coeffs with matching size.
  Act: Call the function set_coefficients with the initialized a_coeffs and b_coeffs.
  Assert: Verify by checking the instance's attributes a_coeffs and b_coeffs, which should be equal to the initialized parameters.
Validation:
  This test validates that the function can correctly set the coefficients when valid parameters are provided. This is a core functionality of the filter, and ensuring it works under regular conditions is a necessary component of the function's specifications.

Scenario 2: Successful coefficient assignment when 'a_coeffs' size doesn’t match the order + 1 but is greater than the order
Details:
  TestName: test_set_coeffs_a_less_order
  Description: This test is intended to verify the successful setting of coefficients when a_coeff list has more numbers of elements than the 'order'.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the IIRFilter object with certain filter order and also initialize a_coeffs as a list with size more than order and a matching b_coeffs.
  Act: Call the function set_coefficients with the initialized a_coeffs and b_coeffs.
  Assert: Assert that an exception is raised with a specific error message.
Validation:
  This test validates that the function raises an error as expected if the input list 'a_coeffs' size is more than expected. This is important for maintaining correct specifications and avoiding unexpected results.

Scenario 3: Validate coefficient assignment when 'b_coeffs' size doesn’t match the 'order'+1
Details:
  TestName: test_set_coeffs_b_less_order
  Description: This test is intended to verify if 'b_coeffs' list has fewer elements than order.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the IIRFilter object with certain filter order and also initialize a_coeffs as a list. Initialize b_coeffs with fewer elements than the 'order'.
  Act: Call the function set_coefficients with the initialized a_coeffs and b_coeffs.
  Assert: Assert that an exception is raised with an expected error message.
Validation:
  This test validates the functionality to check the 'b_coeffs' size against the order. This is crucial for the correctness of the filter and to avoid unexpected results.

Scenario 4: Successful coefficient assignment when 'a_coeffs' size matches order (not order +1)
Details:
  TestName: test_set_coeffs_a_equals_order
  Description: This test is intended to validate the successful insertion of the default value 1.0 to a_coeffs when size of a_coeffs equals the order.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the IIRFilter object with an order and initialize a_coeffs with equals size. Initialize a proper b_coeffs as well.
  Act: Call the function set_coefficients with the initialized a_coeffs and b_coeffs.
  Assert: Check the instance's attribute a_coeffs that should now include 1.0 at the beginning.
Validation:
  This test validates the feature of setting the default value for 'a_coeffs' which is important for gaining the expected behavior even if a_0 is left out.
