Scenario 1: Test the successful setting of coefficients
Details:
  TestName: test_successful_set_coefficients
  Description: This test is intended to verify the successful setting of valid coefficients to the IIR filter.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the IIRFilter object with a certain order, and prepare valid coefficients of size order + 1.
  Act: Invoke the set_coefficients function with the prepared coefficients.
  Assert: Check if the coefficients have been set correctly by comparing them with the input coefficients.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure the basic functionality of setting coefficients is working as expected. The successful execution of this scenario would mean the function is correctly setting the coefficients.

Scenario 2: Test the setting of coefficients when a_coeffs is less than the order
Details:
  TestName: test_set_coefficients_with_less_a_coeffs
  Description: This test is intended to verify the function's behavior when the length of a_coeffs is less than the order.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the IIRFilter object with a certain order, and prepare a_coeffs of size less than the order and valid b_coeffs of size order + 1.
  Act: Invoke the set_coefficients function with the prepared coefficients.
  Assert: Check if the a_coeffs have been set correctly by comparing them with the input coefficients, considering the default value of 1.0 for a_0.
Validation:
  This test is important to verify that the function correctly handles the case where a_coeffs is less than the order and correctly uses the default value of 1.0 for a_0.

Scenario 3: Test the setting of coefficients when a_coeffs and b_coeffs are not of size order + 1
Details:
  TestName: test_set_coefficients_with_invalid_coefficients
  Description: This test is intended to verify the function's behavior when the lengths of a_coeffs and b_coeffs are not of size order + 1.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the IIRFilter object with a certain order, and prepare a_coeffs and b_coeffs not of size order + 1.
  Act: Invoke the set_coefficients function with the prepared coefficients.
  Assert: Check if the function raises a ValueError with the appropriate error message.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the function correctly validates the input and raises an error when the coefficients are not of the correct size. The successful execution of this scenario would mean the function is correctly handling invalid inputs.

Scenario 4: Test the setting of coefficients when b_coeffs is not of size order + 1
Details:
  TestName: test_set_coefficients_with_less_b_coeffs
  Description: This test is intended to verify the function's behavior when the length of b_coeffs is not of size order + 1.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the IIRFilter object with a certain order, and prepare valid a_coeffs of size order + 1 and b_coeffs not of size order + 1.
  Act: Invoke the set_coefficients function with the prepared coefficients.
  Assert: Check if the function raises a ValueError with the appropriate error message.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the function correctly validates the input and raises an error when the b_coeffs are not of the correct size. The successful execution of this scenario would mean the function is correctly handling invalid inputs.
