Scenario 1: Test the successful setting of coefficients
Details:
  TestName: test_successful_set_coefficients
  Description: This test is intended to verify the successful setting of valid coefficients to the IIR filter.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the IIR filter with a specific order.
  Act: Invoke the set_coefficients function with valid a_coeffs and b_coeffs (both of size order + 1).
  Assert: Check that the a_coeffs and b_coeffs of the IIR filter instance have been updated with the new values.
Validation:
  This is important to test as it verifies the primary functionality of the set_coefficients method. The expected outcome aligns with the function's specifications and business requirements.

Scenario 2: Test setting of coefficients when a_coeffs length is less than the filter order
Details:
  TestName: test_set_coefficients_with_less_a_coeffs
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the function correctly handles the case where the length of a_coeffs is less than the filter order.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the IIR filter with a specific order.
  Act: Invoke the set_coefficients function with a_coeffs of size less than order and b_coeffs of size order + 1.
  Assert: Check that the a_coeffs of the IIR filter instance have been updated with the new values and a default value of 1.0 at the beginning.
Validation:
  This test is important as it validates the function's ability to handle cases where a_coeffs length is less than the filter order. The expected result adheres to the function's specifications and business requirements.

Scenario 3: Test setting of coefficients when a_coeffs length is not equal to the filter order + 1
Details:
  TestName: test_set_coefficients_with_invalid_a_coeffs_length
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the function raises a ValueError when the length of a_coeffs is not equal to the filter order + 1.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the IIR filter with a specific order.
  Act: Invoke the set_coefficients function with a_coeffs of size not equal to order + 1 and b_coeffs of size order + 1.
  Assert: Check that a ValueError is raised with the appropriate error message.
Validation:
  This test is crucial as it ensures the function correctly validates the length of a_coeffs. The expected outcome aligns with the function's specifications and business requirements.

Scenario 4: Test setting of coefficients when b_coeffs length is not equal to the filter order + 1
Details:
  TestName: test_set_coefficients_with_invalid_b_coeffs_length
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the function raises a ValueError when the length of b_coeffs is not equal to the filter order + 1.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the IIR filter with a specific order.
  Act: Invoke the set_coefficients function with a_coeffs of size order + 1 and b_coeffs of size not equal to order + 1.
  Assert: Check that a ValueError is raised with the appropriate error message.
Validation:
  This test is important as it validates the function's ability to handle cases where the length of b_coeffs is not equal to order + 1. The expected result adheres to the function's specifications and business requirements.
