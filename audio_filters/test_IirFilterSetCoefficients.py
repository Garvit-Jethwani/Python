Scenario 1: Test the successful setting of coefficients
Details:
  TestName: test_successful_set_coefficients
  Description: This test is intended to verify the successful setting of valid coefficients to the IIR filter.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the IIRFilter object with a certain order, and prepare valid coefficients of size order + 1.
  Act: Invoke the set_coefficients function with the prepared coefficients.
  Assert: Check if the coefficients have been successfully set by comparing them with the input coefficients.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure the basic functionality of setting coefficients is working as expected. The successful setting of coefficients is crucial for the correct functioning of the IIR filter.

Scenario 2: Test setting coefficients with a_coeffs less than order
Details:
  TestName: test_set_coefficients_with_less_a_coeffs
  Description: This test is intended to verify the correct handling when the length of a_coeffs is less than the order. The function should add 1.0 as the default value.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the IIRFilter object with a certain order, and prepare a_coeffs of size less than order and valid b_coeffs.
  Act: Invoke the set_coefficients function with the prepared coefficients.
  Assert: Check if the a_coeffs have been correctly set by comparing them with the input coefficients and the default value 1.0.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the function can correctly handle the situation when a_coeffs is less than the order. This is a part of the function specification and it should be tested to ensure correct implementation.

Scenario 3: Test setting coefficients with a_coeffs not equal to order + 1
Details:
  TestName: test_set_coefficients_with_invalid_a_coeffs
  Description: This test is intended to verify the correct error handling when the length of a_coeffs is not equal to order + 1. The function should raise a ValueError.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the IIRFilter object with a certain order, and prepare a_coeffs of size not equal to order + 1 and valid b_coeffs.
  Act: Invoke the set_coefficients function with the prepared coefficients.
  Assert: Expect a ValueError to be raised.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the function correctly validates the input and raises an error when the length of a_coeffs is not as expected. This is a part of the function specification and it should be tested to ensure correct implementation.

Scenario 4: Test setting coefficients with b_coeffs not equal to order + 1
Details:
  TestName: test_set_coefficients_with_invalid_b_coeffs
  Description: This test is intended to verify the correct error handling when the length of b_coeffs is not equal to order + 1. The function should raise a ValueError.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the IIRFilter object with a certain order, and prepare b_coeffs of size not equal to order + 1 and valid a_coeffs.
  Act: Invoke the set_coefficients function with the prepared coefficients.
  Assert: Expect a ValueError to be raised.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the function correctly validates the input and raises an error when the length of b_coeffs is not as expected. This is a part of the function specification and it should be tested to ensure correct implementation.
