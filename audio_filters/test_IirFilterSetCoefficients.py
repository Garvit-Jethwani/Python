Scenario 1: Testing the successful setting of coefficients
Details:
  TestName: test_successful_set_coefficients
  Description: This test is intended to verify the successful setting of valid coefficients to the IIR filter.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the IIRFilter object with a certain order, and prepare valid coefficients of size order + 1.
  Act: Invoke the set_coefficients function with the prepared coefficients.
  Assert: Check if the coefficients have been successfully set by comparing them with the input coefficients.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure the basic functionality of setting coefficients is working as expected. The successful execution of this scenario would mean the function is correctly setting the coefficients.

Scenario 2: Testing the setting of coefficients when a_coeffs list has less than order elements
Details:
  TestName: test_set_coefficients_with_less_a_coeffs
  Description: This test is intended to verify the automatic addition of 1.0 to the a_coeffs list when its size is less than the order.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the IIRFilter object with a certain order, and prepare a_coeffs of size less than order and valid b_coeffs.
  Act: Invoke the set_coefficients function with the prepared coefficients.
  Assert: Check if the a_coeffs have been successfully set by comparing them with the input coefficients, considering the added 1.0.
Validation:
  This test is crucial to verify the function's ability to handle cases where a_coeffs list has less than order elements. The successful execution would mean the function is correctly adding 1.0 to the a_coeffs list when needed.

Scenario 3: Testing the setting of coefficients when a_coeffs list has more or less than order + 1 elements
Details:
  TestName: test_set_coefficients_with_invalid_a_coeffs
  Description: This test is intended to verify the function's behavior when a_coeffs list has more or less than order + 1 elements.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the IIRFilter object with a certain order, and prepare a_coeffs of size not equal to order + 1 and valid b_coeffs.
  Act: Invoke the set_coefficients function with the prepared coefficients.
  Assert: Expect a ValueError to be raised with the correct error message.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure the function correctly raises an error when a_coeffs list has an invalid size. The successful execution would mean the function is correctly validating the size of a_coeffs list.

Scenario 4: Testing the setting of coefficients when b_coeffs list has more or less than order + 1 elements
Details:
  TestName: test_set_coefficients_with_invalid_b_coeffs
  Description: This test is intended to verify the function's behavior when b_coeffs list has more or less than order + 1 elements.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the IIRFilter object with a certain order, and prepare valid a_coeffs and b_coeffs of size not equal to order + 1.
  Act: Invoke the set_coefficients function with the prepared coefficients.
  Assert: Expect a ValueError to be raised with the correct error message.
Validation:
  This test is crucial to ensure the function correctly raises an error when b_coeffs list has an invalid size. The successful execution would mean the function is correctly validating the size of b_coeffs list.
