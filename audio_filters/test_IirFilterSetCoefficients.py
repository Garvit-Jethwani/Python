Scenario 1: Testing the successful setting of coefficients
Details:
  TestName: test_successful_set_coefficients
  Description: This test is intended to verify the successful setting of valid coefficients to the IIR filter.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the IIRFilter object with a certain order, and prepare valid coefficients of size order+1.
  Act: Call the set_coefficients function with the prepared coefficients.
  Assert: Verify that the coefficients of the IIR filter are set correctly by checking the a_coeffs and b_coeffs attributes of the IIRFilter object.
Validation:
  Rationalize the importance of the test: This test checks the basic functionality of the set_coefficients method, which is crucial for the correct operation of the IIR filter.

Scenario 2: Testing with a_coeffs of size less than order
Details:
  TestName: test_a_coeffs_less_than_order
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the method correctly handles a_coeffs of size less than the order of the filter.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the IIRFilter object with a certain order, and prepare a_coeffs of size less than order.
  Act: Call the set_coefficients function with the prepared coefficients.
  Assert: Verify that a_coeffs of the IIR filter are set correctly by checking the a_coeffs attribute of the IIR filter object.
Validation:
  Rationalize the importance of the test: This test checks that the method correctly handles a_coeffs of size less than order, which is a key feature of the set_coefficients method as per its documentation.

Scenario 3: Testing with a_coeffs of size not equal to order+1
Details:
  TestName: test_a_coeffs_not_equal_order_plus_one
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the method raises a ValueError when a_coeffs of size not equal to order+1 is passed.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the IIRFilter object with a certain order, and prepare a_coeffs of size not equal to order+1.
  Act: Call the set_coefficients function with the prepared coefficients.
  Assert: Expect a ValueError to be raised.
Validation:
  Rationalize the importance of the test: This test checks that the method correctly raises an error when a_coeffs of size not equal to order+1 is passed, which is an important error condition that the method must handle.

Scenario 4: Testing with b_coeffs of size not equal to order+1
Details:
  TestName: test_b_coeffs_not_equal_order_plus_one
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the method raises a ValueError when b_coeffs of size not equal to order+1 is passed.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the IIRFilter object with a certain order, and prepare b_coeffs of size not equal to order+1.
  Act: Call the set_coefficients function with the prepared coefficients.
  Assert: Expect a ValueError to be raised.
Validation:
  Rationalize the importance of the test: This test checks that the method correctly raises an error when b_coeffs of size not equal to order+1 is passed, which is an important error condition that the method must handle.
