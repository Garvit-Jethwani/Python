Scenario 1: Testing the creation of all-pass filter with default q_factor
Details:
  TestName: test_make_allpass_with_default_q_factor
  Description: This test is intended to verify the creation of an all-pass filter using the default q_factor value.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the frequency and samplerate values.
  Act: Invoke the make_allpass function with the initialized frequency and samplerate values.
  Assert: Check if the returned filter's a_coeffs and b_coeffs match the expected values.
Validation:
  The test validates if the function can correctly create an all-pass filter using the default q_factor value. This is important as it ensures the function's default behavior is as expected.

Scenario 2: Testing the creation of all-pass filter with custom q_factor
Details:
  TestName: test_make_allpass_with_custom_q_factor
  Description: This test is intended to verify the creation of an all-pass filter using a custom q_factor value.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the frequency, samplerate and q_factor values.
  Act: Invoke the make_allpass function with the initialized frequency, samplerate and q_factor values.
  Assert: Check if the returned filter's a_coeffs and b_coeffs match the expected values.
Validation:
  The test validates if the function can correctly create an all-pass filter using a custom q_factor value. This is important as it ensures the function's flexibility and adaptability to different q_factor values.

Scenario 3: Testing the creation of all-pass filter with frequency greater than samplerate
Details:
  TestName: test_make_allpass_with_frequency_greater_than_samplerate
  Description: This test is intended to verify the behavior of the function when the frequency is greater than the samplerate.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the frequency and samplerate values such that frequency > samplerate.
  Act: Invoke the make_allpass function with the initialized frequency and samplerate values.
  Assert: Check if the returned filter's a_coeffs and b_coeffs match the expected values.
Validation:
  The test validates if the function can correctly handle and create an all-pass filter when the frequency is greater than the samplerate. This is important as it ensures the function's robustness in handling edge cases.

Scenario 4: Testing the creation of all-pass filter with zero frequency
Details:
  TestName: test_make_allpass_with_zero_frequency
  Description: This test is intended to verify the behavior of the function when the frequency is zero.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the frequency to zero and set a value for samplerate.
  Act: Invoke the make_allpass function with the initialized frequency and samplerate values.
  Assert: Check if the returned filter's a_coeffs and b_coeffs match the expected values.
Validation:
  The test validates if the function can correctly handle and create an all-pass filter when the frequency is zero. This is important as it checks the function's ability to handle edge cases.
